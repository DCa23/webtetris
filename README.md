# webtetris
This is a old piece of code that I did in clasroom

It's a tetris made with JS(basic, not angular or jquery) and Html
It works by moving the pieces using the dom object model, I don't recommend to program any JS game like that but I did it this way because it was a classrom exercice, I think at least it's interesting to share and read the code.
